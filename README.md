# InterPython
Code from my CSCI-200: Programming with Python class
This course covered an intermediate level of Python content.
I included files from our classroom notes and examples, indicated in the filename with "Class".
I also included our applications of the material, such as the Final Project and exam.
I believed I included all the data necessary for the files, but if I missed one let me know!
